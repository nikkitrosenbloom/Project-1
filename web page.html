    <h1>What's the Common Thread Among 10 Years of Plane Crashes?</h1>
    <h3>By: Nikki Rosenbloom</h3>
    <p>Plane crashes are frequently caused by pilot error, mechanical failure, air traffic control errors, and
      weather conditions. But there has been an ostensible increase in the number of crashes over the past few months. 
      The deadliest crash in the last decade happened just <em>one month ago,</em> on June 12th, 2025. So why the recent uptick?
    </p>
    <p>Although aviation reporting standards have improved over the past decade, the databases available to the public are difficult to pick apart, as the reports contain several details that are not as important to the public. 
    </p>
    <p>The Bureau of Aviation Accident Archives sorts plane crashes around the world from the 1960s to today. The online database, founded in Switzerland, organizes the flights by date, operator, aircraft type, location, and fatalities.
    Over the past 10 years,Â there have been 1335 commercial plane crashes, with more than half of them (710 accidents) resulting in fatalities. Of these incidents, aircrafts produced by Cessna and Piper-PA 46 make up the overwhelming majority of crashes.
